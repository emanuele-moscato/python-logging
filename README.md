# Logging in Python

### `logging_example.py`

The `logging` module is among Python's core modules and enables to write logs to stdout, stderr and to file in a basic but effective way.

### `daiquiri_example.py`

The `daiquiri` Python library can be installed with `pip install daiquiri` and constitutes a wrapper around the basic `logging` module, providing some custom formatters and handlers.
